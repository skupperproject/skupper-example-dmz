title: Skupper Hello World DMZ
subtitle: Connect services separated by firewalls and a DMZ
overview: |
  This example is a basic multi-service HTTP application deployed
  across one Kubernetes cluster in the public cloud and another
  Kubernetes cluster in a private data center.  They are separated by
  a DMZ and two firewalls.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
    (<pod>)`.

  * A frontend service that connects to the backend.  It sends
    greetings to the backend and fetches new greetings in response.

  The backend service runs in the private on-prem cluster, and the
  frontend service runs in the public cloud.  The private and public
  sites are linked by a relay site in the DMZ.  Skupper enables the
  frontend to connect to the backend over a secure dedicated
  application network.
